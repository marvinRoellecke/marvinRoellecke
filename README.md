# Hello dear visitor :wave:

My name is Marvin I am 30 years old and based in Kalkar. After travelling across Europe for my last job, I decided to quit and start a new journey.
Today (17.10.22) I joined the **neuefische** *Web Development Boot Camp* to increase my coding skills.
Let's see where it ends...

Here are my favourite hobbies:
- :biking_man: Cycling
