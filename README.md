# Hello dear visitor :wave:

### and welcome to my github profile

My name is Marvin I am 30 years old and based in Kalkar (North Rhine-Westphalia) 

During my time as project manager and field-engineer I gained wide operating experience working with international teams and customers. 
I made the decision to start a new career path as Web Developer and joined the **neuefische** *Web Development Boot Camp*.
After completing the bootcamp I'm happy I did.

### please have a look at my recent repositories:
- [localSports - capstone project](https://github.com/marvinRoellecke/capstone-project-ts)
- [SALT-test](https://github.com/marvinRoellecke/SALT-test)

The other repositories are not relevant and do not represent my skill level, but they show my progress over the time..
